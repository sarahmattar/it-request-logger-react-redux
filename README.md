# it-request-logger-react-redux

A simple logging app for IT-based service requests, built with React and implementing Redux for app level state management. It is a coursework project from Brad Traversy's UDEMY course, [Modern React Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/). 

My previous experience with Redux was very limited, and I had found the state management framework quite cumbersome to use. This time around, I found learning more about React Hooks and Context before re-acquainting myself to Redux afforded a greater understanding of the concepts that Redux employs. 

### Technologies and APIs Used

[Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) - a simple setup for scaffolding a React client. 

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - app-level state management

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a Javascript runtime environment. 

[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) - a CSS and JS framework that implements Google's Material UI. 

[typicode/json-server](typicode/json-server) - an interactive server that allows for a JSON-based datastore without creating an entire SQL or NoSQL database. 

[Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) - a framework which allows a client side application (React) and a server side application (Node) to run in tandem with one another for development purposes.

### Installation Instructions 

Installing the application requires Node.js and [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to be installed.

The `npm run dev` script will allow you to launch the server and client via Concurrently.
